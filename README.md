# Population analysis
Automated analysis of census and IMD data for a defined area

## Purpose
This script analyses census and IMD data by Lower Layer Super Output Area for three predefined areas. LSOA details must first be extracted from the areas of interest - e.g. a project or study area and two related areas such as surrounding buffers. 

## Dependencies
Pandas is required for merging dataframes and reading and writing files. 

## Input requirements
- LSOA codes for areas of interest
- Census and IMD data to be imported as dataframes and analysed.

## Output 
IMD results are output as CSV files and census data results are output as a text file.
